Target discovery, the first stage of early drug discovery, is a time-consuming and crucial process. This is because it is difficult to achieve appropriate efficacy when a drug candidate acts on an inapposite target. For that reason, pharmaceutical companies invest a lot of time and money to find the right target from the beginning. We present AutoTarget, a disease-associated drug target recommendation system using graph theory and machine learning. AutoTarget predicts the structurally equivalent nodes of drug targets on the market, based on the assumption that potential drug targets have similar local structural patterns in protein networks. As a result, researchers can use AutoTarget to check a list of novel drug targets associated with a specific disease.
